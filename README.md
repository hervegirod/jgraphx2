# jgraphx2
A fork of the jgraphx java implementation, but compiled for Java 8

See https://github.com/jgraph/jgraphx for the original implementation.

# Content
The current implementation is a fork of the 4.2.2 version of jgraphx. Note that for the moment we generate both a jgraphx.jar and
a jgraphx2.jar, which contian exactly the same classes as a original implementation, but compiled for Java 8.

# original project
The original jgraphx project is in a EOL phase.

There is a user manual https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/docs/manual_javavis.html that explains the basic architecture. 

There are various examples, https://github.com/jgraph/jgraphx/tree/master/examples/com/mxgraph/examples/swing, from 
the usual HelloWorld to a more complete application example called GraphEditor.

There's also the API specifications at https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/java/docs/index.html
